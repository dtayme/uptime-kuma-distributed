### Bug Reports / Feature Requests

If you want to report a bug or request a new feature, feel free to open a [new issue](https://github.com/dtayme/uptime-kuma-distributed/issues).

### WebSocket Origin Check

WebSocket connections validate the `Origin` header against the configured **Primary Base URL**.  
You can add extra allowed origins in Settings -> General (comma-separated).  
If you run behind a reverse proxy, ensure it forwards `X-Forwarded-Host` and enable `trustProxy` in settings.  
If no base URL is configured, the server falls back to matching against the request host.

### Push Monitor Tokens

Prefer `POST /api/push` with the token in `X-Push-Token` or `Authorization: Bearer` to avoid exposing tokens in URLs.  
Legacy URL-token push endpoints remain available for compatibility.

### Healthcheck TLS Verification

Healthcheck scripts now verify TLS certificates by default when HTTPS is enabled.
If you use a self-signed certificate, set `UPTIME_KUMA_SSL_CERT` to either the CA file path or a PEM string so the healthcheck can trust it.
For local or emergency use only, you can disable verification by setting `UPTIME_KUMA_HEALTHCHECK_INSECURE=1` (not recommended for production).

### NTLM Legacy Crypto

NTLM authentication requires legacy algorithms (MD4/MD5/DES) for protocol compatibility.
Use NTLM only when required and in trusted environments; prefer modern authentication mechanisms when available.
